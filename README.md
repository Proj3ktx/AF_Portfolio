## Plan



## Design
 **REVISE**//change to the first person 

During the design portion of the project we will be utilizing wireframes to construct an outline of the desired website. Next will be choosing the palate to design the website and make it look vibrant. Following this we will be making the flow of the website. The landing page will be a simple and elegant design. A grid composed of 8 squares to represent the 8 topics of discussion I wish to showcase in my website. The 8 topics are as follows : Lego projects, origami projects, skillsusa, robotics projects, home school extracurriculars, tech school, fitness, and an about me page. These 8 squares will be placed in random location of the screen. They will all be the same size and will fit perfectly to fill out the home page. When hovering over any square with your courser the quare will switch from a displayed image relating to the content inside of the topic to a description of what may be found by clicking on it. At the bottom of the page there will be a gallery button. When clicking on the gallery button it will take you to a chart layout of the projects and their descriptions in case you find it easier to navigate that way instead of through the gallery layout of the homepage. Regardless of how you enter, once inside a project space you will be met with a collage of videos, photos, and descriptions which further elaborate on the selected topic. At the top of any project page you will have 4 buttons. The return button to return to the previous page. The gallery button to return to the project gallery. The home page button. Finally the about me button which will direct you to the about me section. While it may be a simple design it is very effective and interconnected so that the user has access to all areas of the website on any page.
