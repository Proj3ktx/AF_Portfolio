## Plan



## Design
 **REVISE**//change to the first person 

During the design portion of the project we will be utilizing wireframes to contruct an outline of the desired website. Next will be choosing the palate to design the website and make it look vibrant. Next will be marking out the flow of the website. 

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my accomplishments through a virtual gallery hosted on a website designed and coded by him. The design for the entire website will be simple but clean. The welcome screen will be a simple grid with a faded welcome in the center. The grid will consist of a variety of sections that will host the different accomplishments wished to be showcased. The grid boxes themselves will have alternating images of the projects hosted in each section. Clicking on any of the grids will take you to that respective section where you will be greeted with a variety of information explaining each project. The initial planning and rough draft of the website should be completed in about 4~6 days. Any advanced features and the details of the website should be completed in the week following the initial planning. Finally, throughout the summer the website will be continuously updated with more projects to showcase.
